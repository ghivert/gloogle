# Gloogle

Gloogle is a search engine, able to query the entirety of the Gleam ecosystem!
Search for a function or a type, and let the magic happen!

[First beta version is available!](https://gloogle.run)

## Features

Some features are already implemented, and some others are still on the roadmap!

- Search for a function or a type by its name
- Search for a function or a type by its type
- Search with a document search accross the gleam ecosystem (with vector search)
- Navigate in the documentation by clicking on types
- Head back to [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm) when looking for something specific
- Find a way to expose the database
- Get GitHub stars for each package on a regular basis
- Enables Search in documentation directly
- Filters included with `in:module`, `in:name`, `in:signature` and `in:documentation`

## Future developments

- Use a proper parser to draw a graph of the function calls
- Add analytics to extract trends
- Get Hex data for each package on a regular basis
- Do something with the GitHub stars

<!-- Is it really useful? -->
<!-- - Implements a full-mirror of hex, in case hex is down (because we can, so why not) -->
<!-- - Add a way to visualise a package directly -->
